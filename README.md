# The REAL Group 5: rstatix
## BIOL 551 Computer Modeling Group Project
### Group 5 members: Sophia Boyd, Brandon Bonilla, Alex Dang, Vivian Vy Le
### Created on: 2022-03-29

For our group project, we are using the [rstatix package](https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix).

Group contributions:

- Brandon Bonilla: Identify Outliers & Shapiro Test
- Sophia Boyd: Summary Statistics & T-test Effect Size
- Alex Dang: T-test & T-test Plotting 
- Vivian Vy Le: ANOVA, ANOVA plotting

Rstatix, in association with 'tidyverse', provides a simple and pipe-friendly foundation for anyone looking to perform statistical tests in R. The package allows user to compute a variety of effect size metrics for plots in functions such as, ANOVA and t-test. Users are also able to conduct comparisons between single or multiple variables simutaneously in identifing outliers, analyzing normality, and assessing variance. In addition to rstatix, 'ggpubr' was also used for t-test plotting. Ultimately, the package provides convienence and organization to users interested in using R for statistical data analysis.     

Group subfolder components: 
- [Data:] Palmerpenguin dataset used
- [Output:] T-test and ANOVA plot images
- [Scripts:] RMarkdown and HTML scripts used
